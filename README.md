# Launchpad drive interface for FRC Robotics 2019

![Launchpad Image](/img/launchpadpic.jpg)

I developed a unique drive system for robots using a launchpad grid originally designed for music production and visualized the layout of the FRC field on it. Each square button corresponds to a location on a complex field. I programmed the robot with path following to be able to respond to a press of a button to a target location and automatically go to it.
